    <!--SKILLS-->
    <h2><u>Skills</u></h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing strengths and
            accomplishments can sometimes feel awkward, but interacting with others is definitely an area where I
            thrive<sup>1</sup>. This natural ability has helped me build strong relationships and navigate various situations
            effectively<sup>2</sup>. Some people in our area even call me <strong>"Kapitana"</strong> because of how
            friendly and approachable
            I am with everyone<sup>3</sup>.
            I also believe I developed leadership skills through my involvement in the <strong>Girl Scouts of the
                Philippines</strong><sup>4</sup>. Serving as a <b>senior Girl Scout</b> taught me the importance of
            responsibility,
            as I was
            tasked with guiding and assisting my fellow scouts<sup>5</sup>.
            While I may not have been confident in assuming leadership roles that required public speaking, such as
            addressing a group, I excelled in demonstrating responsibility through tasks assigned to me<sup>6</sup>.
            I've also gained some basic technical skills from what I learn from my course, and I'm confident they'll
            improve with time<sup>7</sup>.
            There's still a lot more to discover and learn in this area, but I'm hopeful about the opportunities for
            progress and improvement in the future<sup>8</sup>. What matters most to me isn't just skills but it is
            having a good character<sup>9</sup>.
            I believe that's what truly leads to success in life<sup>10</sup>. With integrity and a strong moral
            compass, one can conquer any challenge and thrive<sup>11</sup>.

    <!--HOBBIES-->
    <h2><u>Hobbies</u></h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me capturing everything is really
            important for me as we can turn back time so looking back at the moments through pictures are very precious
            for me, so when thinking of a hobby the first thing that comes to my mind is <strong>photography</strong>
            because of how I love to take picture of every moments<sup>1</sup>. That's why
            photography has become not just a hobby, but a passion for me<sup>2</sup>.
            Whether it's capturing the beauty of a sunset, the laughter shared among friends, or the quiet serenity of
            nature, I find immense joy in capturing these moments<sup>3</sup>.

            If I have a spare time my hobby is to watch <b>korean dramas or romantic comedy movies</b><sup>4</sup>.
            These stories
            not only give me a break from daily stress but also connect with me, showing parts of my own
            life and feelings as a teenage girl dealing with life's ups and downs<sup>5</sup>. It also helps to take
            away our stress as it gives me joy just
            by watching it<sup>6</sup>. As a girl who grew up in the province, <strong>swimming</strong> also become my
            hobby because
            our province has so many beaches that has breathtaking view<sup>7</sup>.
            There's something truly magical about diving into the crystal-clear waters, feeling the cool embrace of the
            ocean, and being surrounded by the natural beauty that surrounds me<sup>8</sup>. Lastly, even though I
            haven't been able
            to travel much due to my busy schedule and the pandemic, <strong>traveling</strong> used to be my favorite
            hobby<sup>9</sup>.
            Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures always brought me so much joy and
            excitement<sup>10</sup>. So,
            whether I'm capturing photos, watching a movie, enjoying the beach, or traveling to new places, each of
            these hobbies adds a special kind of happiness to my life<sup>11</sup>.

    <!--INTEREST-->
    <h2><u>Interest</u></h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a 20-year-old girl, I'm all
            about <strong>adventure, travelling, and trying new things</strong><sup>1</sup>. I also want to prioritize
            my fitness and
            wellness by
            engaging in activities like playing sports, walking, or running to maintain physical and mental
            well-being<sup>2</sup>. I always
            thrive on taking risks and believe in myself to accomplish anything I set my mind to<sup>3</sup>. My aunt
            inspired this
            <b>adventurous</b> side of me, always encouraging me to embrace excitement wherever we went<sup>4</sup>.
            It's
            become a big part
            of who I am, <strong>always seeking out new adventures and finding joy in the unknown</strong><sup>5</sup>. Despite facing
            challenges due
            to my illness, I'm determined to be cautious while still pursuing my passions<sup>6</sup>. Also I would love
            to learn
            sports particularly <b>tennis</b> as my dad loves to play it<sup>7</sup>. It seems exciting, and it could be
            a
            great way for us
            to bond<sup>8</sup>. As I've grown older, I've realized the importance of spending quality time with loved
            ones because
            we never know what will happen in life<sup>9</sup>. However, right now, I'm really into learning
            <strong>website
                design</strong> because Iâ€™m not that creative so I am eager to learn through this subject<sup>10</sup>.
            It's a new challenge that
            excites me and encourages me to grow<sup>11</sup>.
