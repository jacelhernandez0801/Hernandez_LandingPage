    <!--story about my childhood years-->
    <h2 id="childhood"><u>Childhood Years</u></h2>
    <hr size="5" color="black" width="50%">
    <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On <b>August 1, 2003</b>, in the
            town
            of
            <b>Mamburao, Occidental Mindoro</b>, a girl named <b>Jacel Christelle C. Hernandez</b> was born, and that
            girl
            happens
            to be me<sup>1</sup>! I have two siblings, Jade and Jon, and my parents are Menchie and
            Jonathan<sup>2</sup>. As I
            start telling my story, let me first describe my younger self as a jolly, kikay and playful kid, or as they
            say,
            an
            extroverted one<sup>3</sup>. My favorite color is pink<sup>4</sup>. I love to eat sinigang, and my favorite
            thing
            to do is to travel<sup>5</sup>. As a matter of fact, I've been to Hong Kong Disneyland with my family in my
            childhood years, and it is the most unforgettable experience a child can have<sup>6</sup>. Maybe most of
            what I
            remember started from when I was 4 years old, around the year 2007<sup>7</sup>. That's when I began
            attending
            school at <b>Early Skills Learning Center</b> and I spent 3 years of my life there, from nursery,
            kindergarten, to
            preparatory<sup>8</sup>. It's where I experienced many firsts, from learning different things to making
            friends<sup>9</sup>. I even remember crying because I didn't want to be left by mom in the
            classroom<sup>10</sup>.
            I also recall our school's foundation events, where we would parade in our town wearing different
            costumes<sup>11</sup>. I had the chance to be Tinkerbell, Lady Gaga, and many more with my
            costumes<sup>12</sup>. My parents would really make an effort in creating our float for the parade in our
            town<sup>13</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my elementary years at
            <b>Mamburao
                Central School</b>, it was much bigger than my previous school, so I needed time to adjust<sup>14</sup>.
            Life
            became
            more challenging with many new faces to meet and being in a public school meant we had to help in
            cleaning<sup>15</sup>. However, this experience made me responsible<sup>16</sup>. Although, truth be told,
            my
            motivation was different at school because I was more afraid of the teachers than at home, where I'd play as
            soon
            as I arrived<sup>17</sup>. Graduating from grade 6 in my school was a bit emotional for me. I had to bid
            farewell to the teachers who molded me into who I am and to my classmates with whom I shared a strong bond
            with<sup>18</sup>.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My childhood vacations were truly
            special, all thanks to my family for letting us experience it<sup>19</sup>. They always made sure to bring
            us
            cousins together, even if we came from different towns, just to make our family complete<sup>20</sup>.
            That's why
            I grew up close to my cousins, especially on my mother's side. Most of my cherished childhood memories are
            filled
            with joy during vacations in San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, which happens to be my mom's
            hometown<sup>21</sup>.
            They went out of their way to bring our family together, especially during holidays like
            Christmas<sup>22</sup>.
            Growing up was a blast as I got to play, go on vacations, have epic sleepovers, wrestle, and just have a
            blast
            with
            my cousins<sup>23</sup>. It was a whole different level of fun<sup>24</sup>! Life was easy in my
            childhood<sup>25</sup>. It was simple because I was just an innocent kid, thinking about playing, sleeping,
            eating,
            and sometimes studying<sup>26</sup>. And, of course, there were those times when I'd get into little
            arguments
            with my
            siblings and cousins, giving our parents a headache with our mischief<sup>27</sup>.</p>

    <!--story about my teenage years-->
    <h2 id="teenage"><u>Teenage Years</u></h2>
    <blockquote>
        <hr size="5" color="black" width="50%">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my teenage years, I enrolled at
            <b>Occidental Mindoro National High School</b>, where I took an exam to get into the first section known as
            the
            special science class<sup>1</sup>.
            High school life is said to be tough, but it turned out to be the most memorable for me<sup>2</sup>.
            Engaging in
            various activities, tests,
            and unexpected extracurriculars helped me grow<sup>3</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facing reality and various
            challenges
            during high school shaped me<sup>4</sup>.
            Before diving into that, let me share a story of when I joined the <b>Girl Scouts</b>, and had an
            opportunity to
            participate in an event in
            <b>United States of America</b>, a once-in-a-lifetime experience<sup>5</sup>. Grateful for the financial
            support
            extended by my aunt, I was able to represent
            our country during my eighth-grade year<sup>6</sup>. It was a proud moment, facing challenges and becoming
            independent<sup>7</sup>.Despite being young, I conquered
            all the challenges, and after a week of camping, my aunt fetched me, and we explored what the United States
            of
            America can offer<sup>8</sup>.Moving on to grade 10, a date etched in my memory is March 15, 2020 as I
            should be
            graduating junior high school,but it got suspended due to the <strong>COVID-19
                pandemic</strong><sup>10</sup>. The
            rest, as we know, is history<sup>11</sup>.
            I also decided to continue my senior high school in <b>Occidental Mindoro National High School</b> due to
            practical reasons, considering the challenges of having
            online classes in our province, often dubbed as the <b>brownout capital of the Philippines</b><sup>12</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior high school was not easy due
            to
            the self-learning nature of modular classes,
            especially with restrictions on going out<sup>13</sup>.My nightmare extended to <b>October 2020</b> when I
            was in
            Grade 11 I was diagnosed with <strong>Lupus</strong>,
            an <strong>autoimmune disease</strong> in which my own immune system is attacking its own
            tissues<sup>14</sup>. My
            lupus was detected during the midst of COVID-19 pandemic,
            so it was very challenging for me and my family to withstand this health problem<sup>15</sup>. Fortunately,
            unlike
            most cases, my organs are not affected, and it was detected immediately,
            but still, this challenge has made me the strong woman that I am today due to the pressure, medical
            conditions,
            expenses, and social changes that impacted my own view of myself<sup>16</sup>.
            Even if it is hard for me most of the time, I motivated myself that with the help of my family and with God
            nothing is impossible in dealing with the most difficult problems even this health
            implication that I have<sup>17</sup>. I now mark <strong>four years</strong> in my journey as a
            <strong>lupus
                warrior</strong> with the help of medications and regular checkup<sup>18</sup>.
            Amidst this journey, I had the privilege of celebrating my 18th birthday with a small gathering with the
            closest
            people to my heart<sup>19</sup>.My teenage years were unforgettable, showing me my strength in conquering
            challenges<sup>20</sup>. Embracing the belief
            that everything happens for a reason, I am hopeful that the experiences I've encountered will bring lasting
            blessings that stay with me forever<sup>21</sup>.</p>

            girl venturing into the city<sup>1</sup>.
            I enrolled at the <b>University of the East Manila</b>, taking up <b>Bachelor of Science in Information
                Technology</b><sup>2</sup>. I chose this course based on my realizations
            during the pandemic<sup>3</sup>. Initially, I leaned towards a science field course, but circumstances led
            me here
            due to the high demand for IT and the possibility of working from home because as you know I should also
            think of
            what’s best for my condition<sup>4</sup>. </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College life presented challenges
            as we
            embraced independence, handling household chores and making
            significant decisions such as studying in Manila, far from my hometown<sup>5</sup>. Numerous adjustments
            were
            necessary because I had no choice because this is what I want so
            I needed to be physically, mentally, and emotionally prepared to conquer this challenge<sup>6</sup>.But I am
            grateful for the opportunity to study in this prestigious university<sup>7</sup>.
            Not everyone gets the chance, so no matter how tough it gets, I won't waste this opportunity<sup>8</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my freshman year, the first
            semester was still conducted online, and I stayed in Manila due to frequent
            brownouts in our province<sup>9</sup>. While online learning presented challenges, particularly with more
            schoolwork, the added difficulty was coping with homesickness<sup>10</sup>. But thankfully,
            I overcame it and managed to finish the semester with new learnings<sup>11</sup>. Freshman year, second
            semester I
            had a different experience with face-to-face classes<sup>12</sup>. It was exciting and a
            bit overwhelming as I met new people and interacted with professors<sup>13</sup>. It was challenging
            initially,
            but studying hard helped me realize that face-to-face learning provides a more
            enriching experience than online classes<sup>14</sup>. </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I'm in my sophomore year,
            every day comes with its challenges, especially as our workload becomes more demanding<sup>15</sup>.
            College has been a bittersweet journey, where every day is a challenge, but having the right people around
            makes
            it easier as we share the bonds of happiness and hardships together<sup>16</sup>.
            As they say, patience is a virtue<sup>17</sup>. Despite battling with an illness, it won't hinder my pursuit
            of
            success in life<sup>18</sup>. Instead, it becomes my motivation to excel even further in my
            studies<sup>19</sup>.
            In life, we may encounter numerous challenges, yet through resilience and unwavering faith in God, we shall
            survive, as everything happens for a reason<sup>20</sup>. </p>
